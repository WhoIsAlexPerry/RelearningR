What You Will Learn
- Importing data (taking it from where it's stored)
- Tidying (storing it in a consistent form. columns are variables, row are observations)
- Transforming (narrowing into one set, creating new variables, calculating summary statistics)
- Tidying + Transforming = Wrangling
- Visualizing (self-explanatory)
- Models (predictors)
- Communication
- Programming (can simplify things)

Have to download Tidyverse - a set of packages. 

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

install.packages(
  c("arrow", "babynames", "curl", "duckdb", "gapminder", 
    "ggrepel", "ggridges", "ggthemes", "hexbin", "janitor", "Lahman", 
    "leaflet", "maps", "nycflights13", "openxlsx", "palmerpenguins", 
    "repurrrsive", "tidymodels", "writexl")
