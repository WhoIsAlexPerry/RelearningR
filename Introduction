Steps to data science 

- Importing (Take data and load it into a frame in R)
- Tidying (storing it in a consistent form). Each column is a variable and each row is an observation.
- Transform (narrowing in on observations of interest, creating new variables that are functions of existing ones,
and calculating a set of summary statistics like counts or means)
- Tidying + transforming = wrangling (getting data in a form that's natural to work with)

Visualization and modeling are two main engines of knowledge generation. 

Visualization: will show you things you didn't expect or raise new questions. 
Models: mathematical or computational tools.

Communication. 

All the steps above get easier with programming.
