#1.1 Introduction

GGPlot - grammar of graphics, will use ggplot2 in this textbook. 

#1.1.1 Prerequisites

library(tidyverse)

This contains packages used in data analysis. Need to load each time I start a new session.

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

#1.2 First steps
Use the penguins data set to answer the questions in the textbook. 

#1.2.1 The penguins data frame
